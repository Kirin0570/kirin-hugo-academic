I am a fourth-year PhD student in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, supervised by Professor Yazhen Wang, focusing on enhancing quantum algorithms using advanced statistical techniques. I have experience in high-performance computing, machine learning, and data analysis with tools such as Python, Qiskit, R, and C++. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of quantum computing and statistics. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and playing basketball.
