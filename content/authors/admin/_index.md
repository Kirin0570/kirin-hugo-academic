title: Qilin Li
role: PhD student in Statistics
bio: "I am a second-year PhD student in Statitstics. With great interest in the intersection of statistics and computer science, I have been exploring the areas across high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, optimization and network analysis. I have just passed the PhD qualifying exam and now I am looking for a research opportunity preferably in the areas above. I am also open to the topics relevant to data analysis in some more application-oriented contexts such as biomedical science and sports science. Currently, I am taking the course MATH 888 which is about causal inference. My first interest for causal inference comes from the well-known saying: Association does not mean causality. While machine learning algorithms are much better than humans at parsing out small patterns in massive data sets, they struggle to comprehend these minor causal relationships. I hope to learn about causal inference in this course and then try to use causal inference to improve machine learning algorithms.
